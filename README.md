# About

This is concrete5 Job to batch edit all existing users to make anonymous or edit.

For example, you have the production site. You may want to copy the data to test environment.
When you copy the production data, you may want to erase all of existing user information to protect their privacy upon test.

**This is bleeding edge add-on** You need the PHP knowledge.

I want to add a feature to be able to configurable via dashboard. Your PR is welcomed.

If this concrete5 environment is set as `production` or `default`, this job **WILL NOT RUN** for safety measurement.
